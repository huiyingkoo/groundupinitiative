<h2>Farming the land farms our hearts as well</h2>

<p>Farming is all about being connected with the ground and with nature. We plant herbs, we expose ourselves to the&nbsp;medicinal wonders of plants, we look after our terrace of amazing greens and we become so close to the land that we&nbsp;smell of earth. Through that, we maintain a sense of groundedness and humility, farming the land to grow as well as&nbsp;ourselves to cultivate our hearts and our minds.</p>

<h2>Kitchen Support for Mural Painting Project</h2>

<div style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/GUI_Mural_Painting.jpg" style="width:650px" /></div>

<p>Kitchen support includes cooking simple meal of a one-pot dish or two dishes to go with rice or noodles for a group of 20+ persons. The menu for the day has been set and the ingredients will be bought. However, if planning to support this operation for more days, we will invite you to design a plant-based menu prior to cooking the meals.</p>-->
