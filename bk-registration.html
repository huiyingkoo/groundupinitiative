	<h2>Balik Kampung Registration</h2>
		<p><b>Ground-Up Initiative</b> is a nonproft and volunteer-driven community based in Yishun, and we around for more than seven years. From 2012 to 2014, GUI fought very hard to stay on the land that was almost taken away to drive commercial activities, and currently holds a 3+3 year rental lease from the Government since September 2014 to prove that Singapore needs a space like this to nurture risk-taking and creativity, as well as connect people to each other in a nature-inspired space.</p>
		<p><b>Balik Kampung</b> (meaning ‘going home’ in Malay) happens every <u>Saturday</u> and is our flagship community programme and helps us to renew our connection with the land and one another through a variety of tasks that to upkeep the Kampung Kampus, a community campus located in Yishun that is currently being built up by volunteers from all walks of life.</p>
		<p>These activities on the land revolve around the themes of <b>Community Building</b>, <b>Sustainable Living</b> and being a <b>Positive Change</b> in our society.</p>
		<p>We do so by working on the land together through farming, cooking and housekeeping to build up and maintain the space. More importantly, we want to encourage more <b>mindfulness</b> in our lives.</p>

	<h2>Activity Calendar</h2>

<!--<p>Farming is all about being connected with the ground and with nature. We plant herbs, we expose ourselves to the&nbsp;medicinal wonders of plants, we look after our terrace of amazing greens and we become so close to the land that we&nbsp;smell of earth. Through that, we maintain a sense of groundedness and humility, farming the land to grow as well as&nbsp;ourselves to cultivate our hearts and our minds.</p>
